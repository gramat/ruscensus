#### Application Description:  

This **Russian Censuses** shiny application was created as a course project for **Coursera Developing Data Products** course.  
The application shows the distribution of the **age groups** of the **population of Russia** across the census data **since 1897 until 2010**.  

#### An user can:  
1. select the desired census year;  
2. specify a cohorts (age groups) size.   
As a response the app draws the corresponding diagram - **population pyramid**.  

**NB!** To ensure data comparability the application considers the population that is/was dwelling the territory of contemporary Russian Federation ***within the borders of 2013***.  
**NB!** This application is for ***educational purposes*** only. Some or all the ***data may be approximate***.

#### Respects:  
The application uses a very laconic and well done library ***pyramyd*** version 1.4 by ***Minato Nakazawa*** ([Minatos site](http://minato.sip21c.org/), [Pyramyd library page](http://minato.sip21c.org/swtips/R.html#PYRAMID)).  
Pyramyd library contains some (three indeed) functions to draw population pyramid and is available in CRAN repository.
